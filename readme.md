5adiyah.github.io
======
**5adiyah.github.io** is my personal/project website. I'm planning on using it as a testing site for all the new things that I learn during my time at Epicodus.

### To-Do:

- Use Jade
- Try out SCSS/SASS
- Use a responsive Grid (Bootstrap/Foundation/Skeleton)
- Add a blog (Maybe with Jekyll if using github pages)
- For the portfolio boxes, add a hover feature that shows info about the projects
- Add a search feature maybe

### This was set up using:
- Jade
- Skeleton responsive boilerplate

### Installing

**Installing Skeleton**

```
[Download the zip](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton/releases/download/2.0.4/Skeleton-2.0.4.zip)
Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton.git` (Note: this is under active development, so if you're looking for stable and safe, use the zipped download)
```

Installing Jade

```
$ npm install jade
```
